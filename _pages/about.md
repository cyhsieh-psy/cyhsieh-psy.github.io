I am a PhD candidate funded by Ministry of Education, Taiwan. I am a member of [Rastle Lab: Literacy, Language, Learning](https://www.rastlelab.com/), which is based in [Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, Unversity of London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhul-psychology/). 

# Research Interest

I’m a cognitive psychologist/psycholinguist, passionate about how humans read, learn, and process language. My research explores the intersection of **language, cognition, and computational modelling**, with a focus on understanding how people learn to deal with ambiguity that is ubiquitous in human language.

My PhD project focuses on how readers make sense of compound words (e.g., _armchair_, _blood bank_). Specifically, I look into this issue in Chinese compounds, which are the most common word type in the Chinese writing system (e.g., the word for _vase_ in Chinese is composed of _flower_ and _bottle_). 

Additionally, my research follows the principles of open and reproducible science, with an emphasis on transparent methodology, sharing of data and code, and preregistration of studies whenever possible.
