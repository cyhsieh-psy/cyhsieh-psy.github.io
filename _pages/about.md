I am a PhD candidate funded by Ministry of Education, Taiwan. I am a member of [Rastle Lab: Literacy, Language, Learning](https://www.rastlelab.com/), which is based in [Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, Unversity of London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhul-psychology/). 

# Research Interest

I’m a cognitive psychologist/psycholinguist, fascinated by how humans read, learn, and process language. My research lies at the intersection of **language, cognition, and computational modelling**, with a focus on how people navigate the ambiguity that is ubiquitous and inherent in human language.

My PhD project investigates how readers make sense of compound words (e.g., _armchair_, _blood bank_) via their constituents, especially when a constituent word has multiple meanings/senses depending on context (e.g., _bank_ in _blood bank_ vs in _riverbank_). I study this phenomenon in Chinese compounds, the most common word type in the Chinese writing system (e.g., the word for _vase_ in Chinese is composed of _flower_ and _bottle_). 

In addition to my core research, I am deeply committed to transparent, reproducible, and robust research, including preregistration of studies, sharing of data and code, and improving the methodological standards in psychology and psycholinguistics. I have also contributed to methodology-focused projects, including the evaluation of effect size metrics for single-case designs and computational modelling approaches.
