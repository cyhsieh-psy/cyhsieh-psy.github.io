# Hi, I’m Cheng-Yu Hsieh 👋

I’m a cognitive psychologist and to-be lecturer, passionate about how humans read, learn, and process language. My research explores the intersection of **language, cognition, and computational modelling**, with a focus on understanding how people recognize and interpret written words across different languages.  

I currently collaborate with researchers at [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhul-psychology/) and have presented my work at conferences across Europe and Asia.  

I am a PhD candidate funded by Ministry of Education, Taiwan. I am a member of [Rastle Lab: Literacy, Language, Learning](https://www.rastlelab.com/), which is based in [Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, Unversity of London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhul-psychology/). 

# Research Interest

I am interested in how readers acquire linguistic knowledge through text experience and how they apply such abstract knowledge to their daily encounters of texts. My current research specifically focuses on the learning of Chinese character knowledge through exposure to compound words.
