I am a PhD candidate funded by Ministry of Education, Taiwan. I am a member of [Rastle Lab: Literacy, Language, Learning](https://www.rastlelab.com/), which is based in [Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, Unversity of London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhul-psychology/). 

Research Interest
======
I am interested in how readers acquire linguistic knowledge through text experience and how they apply such abstract knowledge to their daily encounters of texts. My current research specifically focuses on the learning of Chinese character knowledge through exposure to compound words.  

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
