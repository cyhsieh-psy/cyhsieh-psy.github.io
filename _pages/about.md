I am a PhD candidate funded by Ministry of Education, Taiwan. I am a member of [Rastle Lab: Literacy, Language, Learning](https://www.rastlelab.com/), which is based in [Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, Unversity of London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rhul-psychology/). 

# Research Interest

I’m a cognitive psychologist/psycholinguist, passionate about how humans read, learn, and process language. My research explores the intersection of **language, cognition, and computational modelling**, with a focus on understanding how people learn to deal with ambiguity that is ubiquitous in human language.

My PhD project focuses on how readers make sense of compound words (e.g., _armchair_, _blood bank_). Specifically, I look into this issue in Chinese compounds, which are the most common word type in the Chinese writing system (e.g., the word for _vase_ in Chinese is composed of _flower_ and _bottle_). I am interested in how readers acquire linguistic knowledge through text experience and how they apply such abstract knowledge to their daily encounters of texts. My current research specifically focuses on the learning of Chinese character knowledge through exposure to compound words.
